                filmed the whole event and said: "I expected a rat. But the small chap... it was a bit of a relief really," according to Pix 11.
                Balasubramaniam added that most passengers got off at Roosevelt Avenue to get onto new carriages, such was their horror, and that the people shown in the video were in fact the 'brave' ones.</p>

                <li><h3>Sweden December 12 2016 Stash house in Sweden covered up as "mouse cafe"</h3></li>
                <blockquote><p>Along with everything else, now we have a mysterious street art group – appropriately named Anonymouse MMX – making mouse cafes. The roughly 1-foot by 2-foot storefronts are tucked into basement windows in Malmö, Sweden. They offer the city's small scampering residents an irresistible array of mouse delicacies – nuts, cheese, and the likes. 
                “It’s just too darn charming to imagine a world where mice lives parallel to ours but just slightly out of sight,” a representative of Anonymouse MMX told NSSIA.“They are built of things that we had laying around and also things we collected, like caps, lids from tin cans, matches, buttons, a lamp shade, Italian stamps etc.,” the representative continued. “The idea was to use things mice themselves could have collected and reused.” Swedish police warn passerbys
                to not get near or tamper with the "mouse cafe". Swedish police chief stated that the "mouse cafes" are possible store fronts for money laundering and other illegal mafia activities. And who is the number one suspect for Swedish Police? You guessed it .....Danger Mouse. Here's a link to the whole story</p>
                <p>NSSIA involvement rating: 8 out of 10.</p>
                <p>We can't prove that Danger Mouse is involved, but it's highly likely he's the head of the artsy fartsy street art group Anonymouse MMX.  </p></blockquote>
                
                <li><h3>Italy July 17 2012 Possible ties to the Camorra mafia. </h3></li>
                <blockquote><p>Italy's 'Mozzarella King' arrested over 'contaminated cheese'. The head of Italy's biggest producer of mozzarella cheese, nicknamed "the Mozzarella King", was arrested after being accused of producing contaminated cheese and receiving money from the Camorra mafia.
                        Police said Mr Mandara, who was photographed chomping on a cigar as he was led away by officers, was arrested on suspicion of mafia association and endangering public health. They said two tons of the company’s mozzarella may have been contaminated with minute ceramic fragments from a broken machine.
                        The company was also accused of passing off ordinary provolone cheese as being of a more superior quality with false labelling. Following news of his arrest, Mr Mandara was expelled from the Consortium for the Promotion of Buffalo Mozzarella after an emergency meeting of its council, which described the allegations as “very serious”. Here's a link to the rest of the story
