      <blockquote>
        <p>New York City Police were called to the scene of a NYC subway to investigate a possible terror attack. The unidentified
          subject caused havoc and terror amongst NYC subway riders. Eyewitness Augustus Balasubramaniam filmed the whole
          event and said: "I expected a rat. But the small chap... it was a bit of a relief really," according to Pix 11.
          Balasubramaniam added that most passengers got off at Roosevelt Avenue to get onto new carriages, such was their
          horror, and that the people shown in the video were in fact the 'brave' ones.</p>
        <p>NSSIA involvement rating: 10 out of 10.</p>
        <p>Danger Mouse is definitely involved in this terror attack.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Along with everything else, now we have a mysterious street art group – appropriately named Anonymouse MMX – making
          mouse cafes. The roughly 1-foot by 2-foot storefronts are tucked into basement windows in Malmö, Sweden. They offer
          the city's small scampering residents an irresistible array of mouse delicacies – nuts, cheese, and the likes.
          “It’s just too darn charming to imagine a world where mice lives parallel to ours but just slightly out of sight,”
          a representative of Anonymouse MMX told NSSIA.“They are built of things that we had laying around and also things
          we collected, like caps, lids from tin cans, matches, buttons, a lamp shade, Italian stamps etc.,” the representative
          continued. “The idea was to use things mice themselves could have collected and reused.” Swedish police warn passerbys
          to not get near or tamper with the "mouse cafe". Swedish police chief stated that the "mouse cafes" are possible
          store fronts for money laundering and other illegal mafia activities. And who is the number one suspect for Swedish
          Police? You guessed it .....Danger Mouse. Here's a link to the whole story</p>
        <p>NSSIA involvement rating: 8 out of 10.</p>
        <p>We can't prove that Danger Mouse is involved, but it's highly likely he's the head of the artsy fartsy street art
          group Anonymouse MMX. </p>

        <h3>Possible ties to the Camorra mafia with 'contaminated cheese' </h3>
      </li>
      <h6>Italy July 17 2017</h6>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The head of Italy's biggest producer of mozzarella cheese, nicknamed "the Mozzarella King", was arrested after being
          accused of producing contaminated cheese and receiving money from the Camorra mafia. Police said Mr Mandara, who
          was photographed chomping on a cigar as he was led away by officers, was arrested on suspicion of mafia association
          and endangering public health. They said two tons of the company’s mozzarella may have been contaminated with minute
          ceramic fragments from a broken machine. The company was also accused of passing off ordinary provolone cheese
          as being of a more superior quality with false labelling. Following news of his arrest, Mr Mandara was expelled
          from the Consortium for the Promotion of Buffalo Mozzarella after an emergency meeting of its council, which described
          the allegations as “very serious”. Here's a link to the rest of the story
